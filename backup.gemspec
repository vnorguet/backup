    Backup is a RubyGem, written for UNIX-like operating systems, that allows you to easily perform backup operations
    on both your remote and local environments. It provides you with an elegant DSL in Ruby for modeling your backups.
    Backup has built-in support for various databases, storage protocols/services, syncers, compressors, encryptors
    and notifiers which you can mix and match. It was built with modularity, extensibility and simplicity in mind.
